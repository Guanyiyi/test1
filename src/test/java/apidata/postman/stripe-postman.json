See https://stripe.com/docs/api for more details.\n## Prerequisites\n[Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/downloads/)\n\n[Stripe Account](https://dashboard.stripe.com/register)\n## Getting Started\nTo get started fork the collection from [Stripe's public workspace](https://www.postman.com/stripedev/workspace/stripe-developers/overview) within Postman.\n\n![Fork collection](https://raw.github.com/stripe/stripe-postman/master/screenshots/postman_fork_collection.png)\n\nEnter a name for your fork and select the workspace where it will be created:\n\n![Fork form](https://raw.github.com/stripe/stripe-postman/master/screenshots/postman_fork_form.png)\n\nYou can also fork the environment template from the Stripe Developers Workspace:\n\n![Fork environment template](https://raw.github.com/stripe/stripe-postman/master/screenshots/postman_fork_env_template.png)\n\n### Set your API key\nTo run requests you'll need to supply your [testmode secret API key](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/apikeys) and set it as an [environment variable](https://learning.postman.com/docs/sending-requests/variables/) within your workspace.\n\nTo set any environment variable, create a new envionment within Postman:\n\n![create a new environment](https://raw.github.com/stripe/stripe-postman/master/screenshots/postman_create_new_env.png)\n\nAdd your secret key as a variable to the environment and save:\n\n![set API key](https://raw.github.com/stripe/stripe-postman/master/screenshots/postman_set_key_and_save.png)\n\nSet the environment to active:\n\n![save as active](https://raw.github.com/stripe/stripe-postman/master/screenshots/postman_set_active_env.png)\n\nNow within the collection set it to use the environment you just created:\n\n![set collection environment](https://raw.github.com/stripe/stripe-postman/master/screenshots/postman_set_collection_environment.png)\n\nIf your environment is set up correctly, you should see your secret key value if you mouse over the `secret_key` variable in the Token field:\n\n![secret key mouseover](https://raw.github.com/stripe/stripe-postman/master/screenshots/postman_secret_key_mouseover.png)\n\n\n\nBe sure to save the collection after you've configured the set the key:\n\n![save key](https://raw.github.com/stripe/stripe-postman/master/screenshots/postman_save_key.png)\n\n## Make a test call\nYou should be ready now to make a test call. An easy first call is to create a customer:\n\n![customer endpoints](https://raw.github.com/stripe/stripe-postman/master/screenshots/postman_customer_endpoints.png)\n\nSince no parameters are required to create a customer, you can just hit the Send button to run this request:\n\n![create customer send](https://raw.github.com/stripe/stripe-postman/master/screenshots/postman_create_customer_send.png)\n\nIf your environment is set up you'll get a customer object back as the response to the call:\n\n![create customer send](https://raw.github.com/stripe/stripe-postman/master/screenshots/postman_customer_create_no_params_response.png)\n\n\nAdd parameters to the call by clicking the body tab, where you'll see a list of available parameters.  Select and populate the ones you want to use. Here's an example of adding an email parameter:\n\n![create customer with email](https://raw.github.com/stripe/stripe-postman/master/screenshots/postman_create_customer_with_email_request.png)\n\nYou'll see the email address in the reponse:\n\n![create customer with email](https://raw.github.com/stripe/stripe-postman/master/screenshots/postman_create_customer_with_email_response.png)\n\n## Passing Metadata In a Request\nRight now [metadata](https://stripe.com/docs/api/metadata) does not show up as a optional parameter on requests, but it can still be provided to calls that will accept it.  Here's an example of adding 2 metadata fields to the customer create call:\n\n![set metadata on a request](https://raw.github.com/stripe/stripe-postman/master/screenshots/postman_set_metadata.png)\n\nMetadata key value pairs can be updated in a similar manner. To remove a metadata key during an update call, supply the `metadata[key]` parameter without setting a value.  This will pass an empty string as part of the request:\n\n![clear metadata key](https://raw.github.com/stripe/stripe-postman/master/screenshots/postman_update_metadata.png)\n\nTo remove all metadata pass the `metadata` parameter without a value set:\n\n![remove metadata key](https://raw.github.com/stripe/stripe-postman/master/screenshots/postman_remove_metadata.png)\n\n## Changelog\n\n##
